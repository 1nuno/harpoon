# WARNING
This is still beta.  We are getting there, but its not as fast as I would like.
Therefore APIs are subject to change.

# harpoon
The goal of Harpoon is to get you where you want with the fewest keystrokes.

## The Problem
You work on code.  The code base is medium, large, tiny, whatever.  You find
yourself frequenting a small set of files (maybe it depends on task) and you
are tired of using a fuzzy finder, :bnext/prev, alternate file doesn't quite
cut it, etc etc.

## The Solution
The ability to specify, or on the fly, mark and create persisting key strokes
to go to the files you want.  This includes terminal navigation.

## Installation
Simply install via your favorite plugin manager.

```
Plug 'ThePrimeagen/harpoon'
```
